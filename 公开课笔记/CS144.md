# CS 144 An Introduction to Computer Networks

##  The 4 Layer Internet Model

The Internet is made up of end-hosts, links and routers. **Data is delivered hop-by-hop over each link in turn.** Data is delivered in packets. A packet consists of the data we want to be delivered, along with a header that tells the network where the packet is to be delivered, where it came from and so on.

### the Link layer

The Link Layer’s job is to carry the data over one link at a time.
Eg : Ethernet and WiFi

### the Network layer : The network layer is "special"
网络层必须使用 Internet 协议

- packets可能失去/损坏/复制，no guarantees
- must use the IP
- may be out of order



The network layer’s job is to **deliver packets end-to-end across the Internet from the source to the destination.**

注意这里所提到的 `packet` (还记得上课背这玩意结构的恐惧)

> A packet is the name we give to a self-contained collection of data, plus a header that describes what the data is, where it is going and where it came from.

Network layer packets are called `datagrams`. They consist of some data and a head containing the “To” and “From” addresses .

The Network hands the datagram to the Link Layer below, telling it to send the datagram over the first link.

#### IP

IP : The first is that IP is often referred to as **“the thin waist”** of the Internet | 意思是说你不管干啥你都的走ip协议，因为 network 只有 IP，所有的服务都要使用 ip



IP runs over many different Link Layers, such as Ethernet, WiFi, DSL,3G cellular, and so on.

- IP makes a best-effort attempt to deliver our packets to the other end. But it **makes no promises.**
- IP packets can **get lost**, can be **delivered out of order**, and can be **corrupted**. 
- There are no guarantees.

### the IP Service Model



### 1.9 ipv4

-  An IPv4 address identifies a device on the Internet

    - Layer 3 (network) address
- 32 bits long (4 octets): a.b.c.d
-  Netmask: 那些ip地址是本地的，那些ip地址是需要转发的
    -  Netmask of 255.255.255.0 means if the first 24 bits match
    -  Netmask of 255.255.252.0 means if the first 22 bits match
    -  按位与运算来判断两个ip是否在同一网络


小测验：两个ip是否在同一网络下

- 第一行：NO 34和35
- 第二行：YES 
- 第三行：NO
- 第四行：NO
- 第五行：YES

#### how are IP addresses assigned 如何分配ipv4地址

- 分为 ABC 三种
- 每类分为：network + host

## 1.10 Longest Prefix Match 最长前缀匹配

## 1.11  ARP  Address Resolution Protocol
